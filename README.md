# Overview

I haven't used C# before, and I didn't want to start off too in over my head, so I figured a simple inventory management project would be a good way to start. I've done a lot with C++, but C# is a bit different. Additionally, this project gave me a decent proof of concept for a project I've talked about with another company.

This project simply allows you to create inventory "Items" that keep track of an ID number, description, and quantity. In writing this, I wanted to practice error handling, using methods and functions, as well as general conditional logic and basics in C#. I also used files to keep track of some data, so I was able to practice file management in C# as well.

# Development Environment

I used the .NET framework through Visual Studio 2022 Community version. I started with the basic Console App template and went from there.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Managing searching efficiency (currently O(n), could be better)
- Allowing users to include '@' characters in their descriptions (currently would break the program)
- Add ability to display current inventory in the program
- Add option to make a .csv formatted document for inventory display
